Description:
    Outputs of habitat suitability models (aka species distribution models) of 59 families 
    of stream macroinvertebrates, 11 native species of fish, and female and total platypus in
    the Melbourne (SE Australia) region. Predict fish species, platypus, and macroinvertebrate 
    family occurrence and macroinvertebrate indices  (LUMaR, SIGNAL2, number of sensitive 
    families) for any reach in the region.  Calculate the indices based on imported data 
    and compare to predicted values.  Diagnostic tools for interpreting results.
